# inputscrub
Sandbox for testing input validation on api endpoints with [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) and react input fields with [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup).

Core input validation is done on the backend to protect data in postgres. Validation on the client is mostly for user convenience.
